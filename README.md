## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related in that service workers enable web applications to function even when parts of the system, such as the network connection, are unavailable. Graceful degradation is the concept of designing software to still provide core functionality under reduced conditions. Service workers contribute to graceful degradation by caching key assets and responses, allowing apps to work offline instead of completely failing when the internet is not available.
